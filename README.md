# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction System

A complete end-to-end **Machine Learning project** that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) using historical telecom customer data. The system is built with **Python, Machine Learning, FastAPI, Docker, and AWS** and provides **real-time churn predictions via an API**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest business challenges in the telecom industry. Retaining existing customers is far cheaper than acquiring new ones.

This project uses machine learning to:

✅ Analyze customer behavior  
✅ Identify customers at risk of leaving  
✅ Help businesses take early retention actions  

The model is trained on the **IBM Telecom Churn Dataset (7,000+ records)** and deployed as a **real-time prediction API**.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

### ✔ Problem Type  
**Binary Classification** (Churn = Yes / No)

### ✔ Algorithms Used  
- Logistic Regression  
- CatBoost Classifier (**Final Best Model**)

### ✔ Techniques Applied  
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering  
- Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding  
- SMOTE for Class Imbalance Handling  
- Train-Test Split  
- Hyperparameter Tuning  
- Ensemble Learning for Performance Boost  

### ✔ Final Model Performance  
- **F1 Score: 86%**  
- High recall for churn class (crucial for business retention)
